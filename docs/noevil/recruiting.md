## F.A.Q. Responses

### "Why should I join a house? What are the benefits?"

> We're willing to help teach players through boot camp or answering questions + some people using alts for low rank matches

> For starters stipends, it help with the unit kit losses when playing the game.

> Shared units, once you join the house there will be units you can used shared by other player to get you up in firepower, not only that also to test the units in battle, to see if you like the unit
